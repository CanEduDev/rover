# Calibrating the Rover

This page describes how to calibrate the Rover's inputs. While we calibrate all Rovers we ship, this resource can be useful if you've accidentally reset the calibration or if you are unhappy with the factory calibration.

/// note | Radio Transmitter Model
These instructions are for the **FlySky FS-G7P** radio transmitter that ships with the Rover.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. Place the Rover on a box or somewhere where all four wheels can freely move without touching anything.

2. Start the Rover by connecting the battery and pressing the power switch.

3. Turn on the radio. Go into the radio settings by pressing down the Enter button (the button below the screen with the blue light).

4. Navigate to "EPA" (end point adjustment). Press "Enter".

5. Set all "ST" and "TH" values to 120%.

6. Go back to the main menu.

7. Center the trims by moving the "TR" button until the "ST" and "TH" gauges are centered. "ST" is controlled by moving the "TR" button left and right, and "TH" is controlled by moving it up and down. Each step moved with the "TR" button will cause the radio to play a sound, but when the gauges are centered, the radio will play a different sound.

8. Reset the calibration status of the Rover by holding the "SW2" button for more than 5 seconds, then releasing.

9. Move the steering knob fully to one side and hold for two seconds. Move it to the other side and hold for 2s. Make sure the bar on the screen goes to the max and min. Repeat for the throttle lever: move it to full throttle, hold for 2s, then move it to full brake and hold for 2s. This should tell the Rover what the maximum and minimum values of the radio are.

10. If the wheels are not centred when no steering is applied, adjust the steering trim by moving the "TR" button on the radio to the right or left until the wheels are centred.

11. Start the motor while the throttle lever is released. If the wheels start moving, adjust the throttle trim by moving the "TR" button on the radio up or down until the wheels are stopped. Then, try to accelerate and brake, followed by reversing and then braking. If the reverse is not working properly, increase the throttle trim until it does.

12. To confirm the calibration, make sure the steering knob and the throttle lever are in the neutral position by not touching them. Press and hold the "SW2" button for at least 1 second, but no more than 5 seconds, to apply the calibration. This will change the neutral position of the steering and throttle to the values set on the trim. NOTE: this might make the wheels spin and/or turn, since the trim on the radio will be applied on top of the new calibrated values. Now, center the trims on the radio as explained in step 7. The wheels should go back to how they were before pressing the "SW2" button, and the Rover will be calibrated.

13. If you for some reason need to redo the calibration, for example when you've switched to a different radio or you are not happy with the calibration, you can repeat steps 7-12.
