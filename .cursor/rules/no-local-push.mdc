title: No Local Push

# Never Run Push Command Locally

When working with the [build-ros-gateway.sh](mdc:scripts/build-ros-gateway.sh) script:

- **NEVER** use the `--push` flag when running the script locally
- The `--push` flag should only be used in CI environments (GitHub Actions)
- Local development should only use `--load` (which is automatic) to load images into the local Docker daemon
- Pushing to registries should only happen in controlled CI environments

## Correct Usage:
```bash
# ✅ Local development - builds and loads locally
./scripts/build-ros-gateway.sh --ros-distro humble

# ✅ Local development with version tags - builds and loads locally
./scripts/build-ros-gateway.sh --ros-distro humble --version-tags "v1.0.0"

# ❌ NEVER do this locally
./scripts/build-ros-gateway.sh --ros-distro humble --push
```

## CI Usage (GitHub Actions):
- The `--push` flag is automatically added by the GitHub Actions workflow
- CI environments handle authentication and registry pushing
- Local development should focus on building and testing, not deployment
