The AGENT.md file contains:
- Complete project overview and architecture
- Hardware components and software architecture
- Key technologies (Meson build system, FreeRTOS, CAN Kingdom protocol)
- Project structure and directory organization
- Communication protocol details (CAN Kingdom, message types)
- Development workflow and build instructions
- Testing strategies and debugging tools
- Common development tasks and best practices

When working on this project:
1. **Always start by reading [AGENT.md](mdc:AGENT.md)** to understand the context
2. Use the information in AGENT.md to guide all development decisions
3. Follow the established patterns and workflows described in AGENT.md
4. Reference the specific file paths and build commands from AGENT.md
5. Use the troubleshooting and debugging information from AGENT.md
